# Flutter in app purchase - firebase functions backend

I've submitted PR for original codelab but meanwhile maybe it'll help someone. 
This is just updated and working version of codelab example [codelab iap](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-in-app-purchases#9)

## Changes made

- Upgraded to node 18
- Updated packages
- Switched to ESM modules
- Fixed imports
- Updated deploy functions that didn't work

## How to use it (original codelab instructions)
